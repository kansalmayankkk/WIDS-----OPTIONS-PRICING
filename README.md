# WiDS-Options-Pricing
In this project, we’re diving into Options Pricing using Python, taking a fresh look at the Black-Scholes Equation — the backbone of options theory. While Black-Scholes is a classic, it relies on some pretty outdated assumptions about volatility and interest rates, which don’t always hold up in today’s fast-moving markets.

To tackle this, we’ll use Deep Learning models like Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models let us capture real-time market trends by using recent price and volatility data, making our predictions way more adaptive and accurate than the old-school approach. We will certainly build MLP1, MLP2, and the LSTM model, which take 20-day historical volatility as an input, while the LSTM model takes in the latest 20 days of underlying price, allowing it to learn volatility. 

By the end, you’ll get hands-on with data processing and learn how to build models that go beyond Black-Scholes, blending finance and AI for modern, flexible options pricing. This project is a great way to get practical experience and add something unique to your profile.

# Prerequisites
There are no hard prerequisites - just bring your enthusiasm and a willingness to dive in! We’ll provide the resources and tools; your curiosity and commitment will shape how much you gain from this experience. While not required, a basic familiarity with Python and Options Pricing would be a nice bonus.
